# HEY THERE!

## YES, YOU.

Hi there! I'm Nick. Iâ€™m a physics major turned programmer. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for physics course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Below is a compilation of some of my favourite things that I have built over the years. You may find everything else on my <a href="http://github.com/lenpaul" target="_blank">Github</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/lenpaul" target="_blank">Code Pen</a> profiles.

Let's test some $$\LaTeX$$, shall we?

$$\alpha = \dot{\theta}$$




~~~ python
for i in range(10):
    print('test')
~~~
