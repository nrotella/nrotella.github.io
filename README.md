This github repo is used to managed my [personal website](https://nrotella.github.io).

I used the excellent [Lagrange](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/) Jekyll theme and modified it to retain its minimalist/blog-first support while incorporating some bootstrap-like features (and getting a quick refresher on HTML/CSS, javascript as well as learning a bit of Liquid and markdown in the process).
